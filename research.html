								<h3>The APF A-star Retirement Program (AARP)</h3>
								<p>Subgiant stars (slightly evolved stars) are a relatively understudied population in planet searches, but represent a unique sample for probing how stellar evolution and stellar mass affect planet demographics. 
                                    The "Retired" A-star program monitored the radial velocities of a sample of subgiants for nearly two decades with Keck-HIRES, discovering mroe than 50 planets orbiting such stars (see my 2019 paper <a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....157..149L/abstract>here</a> for some recent discoveries/candidates).
                                </p>
                                <p>As my thesis work showed, evolved stars are dominated by stellar variability driven by convective motions, specifically p-mode oscillations, the global surface deformations that result from pressure driven waves driven from convection that travel throughout the interior of the star.
                                    These p-mode oscillations can have amplitudes 3–10 m/s, indicating that <b>the residuals in the RV time series of subgiants are dominated by stellar signals</b>; we've hit an astrophysical floor that could be drowning out the signals of any companions in these systems!
                                </p>
                                <p>Luckily, p-mode oscillations have a well understood temporal structure, with characteristic cycling behavior on timescales that are closely tied to stellar parameters (effective temperature and surface gravity). 
                                    For dwarf stars, we can mitigate the typical ~5 minute oscillations by choosing sufficiently long exposure times that average over the p-mode period.
                                    For subgiant stars&#8212;with sometimes hours-long cycles&mdash;this strategy simply isn't practical. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Instead, I've devised a new survey strategy for evolved stars that aims to leverage the <em>anti</em>correlated nature of p-mode oscillations, by precisely spacing two observations in a night. 
                                    By taking a second exposure separated by exactly half of the dominant p-mode oscillation timescale, the observations will bin down faster than typical sqrt(N) white noise, allowing us to probe below the p-mode floor.
                                </p>
                                <p>We have implemented this approach on the Automated Planet Finder (APF) telescope, a fully robotic telescope at Lick Observatory dedicated to RV observations.
                                    It's robotic nature allows us to specify the unique intra-night cadence for each star, according to its p-mode oscillation timescale.
                                </p>

                                <p>We're calling this survey the <b>A</b>PF <b>A</b>-star <b>R</b>etirement <b>P</b>rogram (<b>AARP</b>), and the goals of our program are to:</p>

                                <p>We have a year of observations under our belt and our results show promise.
                                    APF has demonstrated excellent ability to achieve the desired intra-night cadences within +/-10 minutes.
                                    Our initial results indicate moderate improvement over HIRES and more importantly appear to perform better than the expected sqrt(2) reduction one would expect from 2 randomly separated observations in the night, assuming a white noise component.
                                </p>
                                <p>We're excited for the future of this program and the discoveries it will enable. Stay tuned for a first write-up of the survey and initial performance!</p>
