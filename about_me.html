								<p>I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of California, Irvine. I received my PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics from the Pennsylvania State University in 2021 under the supervision of Prof. Jason Wright. I completed my undergraduate degree at The Ohio State University in 2015, double-majoring in Physics and Astronomy, with a minor in History of Art. I am originally from Lima, Ohio, where I attended Elida High School.</p>
									
								<p>Outside of astronomy I dabble in a variety of hobbies. I enjoy photography, especially landscape photography, and I love being able to travel and photograph new places. I tried my hand at a bit of astrophotography, but nothing much more than taking my DSLR out to a dark sky somewhere. In a similar vein to photography, I occasionally paint, a hobby I picked up after taking a painting course during a summer in Paris in 2013. I don’t paint as often as I would like, but I've found it's a very enjoyable process and is completely different from my day-to-day astronomy work. I also enjoy playing piano.</p>
								<p>Other than that, I enjoy watching movies and I’m always ready to watch a movie I haven’t seen before, especially the classics that I’ve never seen but have been on my watchlist for a long time (making slow and steady progress). I’m a huge fan of the Green Bay Packers (Go Pack Go!) and NFL football in general. I watch a fair amount of sports and play a few as well. My favorite sport to play is ultimate frisbee, and I've recently joined a club team: Orange County Erosion.</p>
